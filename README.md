## General info
This is a chat room. Enter a nickname and a room name before choosing to create or join a room.
Every nickname can only be used once and you cannot create a room that already exists.

## Technologies
The project is created with Python Flask, using MongoDB and hosted on Heroku.

It also uses various libraries included in the requirements.txt file.

## Setup
To run this project, visit [this website.](https://zan-chameleon.herokuapp.com)

## Future Developments
Originally, the goal was to implement a web version of board game [The Chameleon](https://bigpotato.com/gb/games/the-chameleon/). However, due to time constraints I've only completed a chat room. Check back in the future for working version of the board game.
